**Product, Item, and Cart Management:**

The project includes classes for managing products, individual items in a cart, and the cart itself. Each product has an ID, name, and price. The item class represents products in specific quantities, and the cart class manages a collection of items.

**Interactive Shopping Experience:**

The program provides an interactive loop where users can add items to the cart, view the cart's contents, and proceed to checkout. The user inputs actions to manage the shopping process, simulating a real-world shopping experience.

**Product Selection and Cart Operations:**

Users can view a list of available products, choose products to add to the cart by entering the first letter of the product name, view the cart's current contents, and see the total cost of items in the cart.

**Checkout and Payment Handling:**

The checkout process allows users to finalize their purchase by paying the total amount. The program checks if the payment is sufficient, provides change if needed, and thanks the user for their purchase if successful. If the payment is insufficient, it prompts the user to pay again.
